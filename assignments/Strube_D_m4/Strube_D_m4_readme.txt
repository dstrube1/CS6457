Milestone 4

Main scene: demo

1.) The AI controlled Minion visits 5 stationary waypoints.

2.) The AI controlled Minion then heads off the moving waypoint and has a visualization of minionâ€™s predicted position (visible destination tracker object). The prediction updates every frame and the minion reaches the actual waypoint. 

3.) The AI is controlled by procedural state machine of 2 states where the minion visits 5 stationary waypoints, then heads off moving waypoint, then goes back to visiting 5 stationary waypoints, then heads off moving waypoint, etc.

4.) The Minion is animated with steps and not sunk into ground.

5.) I used the Auditor to test my build.

6.) The correct camera perspective and the minion performing the appropriate AI behaviors can be seen.

Any assignment requirements that have not been completed or don't work correctly: 
	Sometimes the Minion AI's destination tracker doesn't perfectly target the moving waypoint, but other times it does.

External assets: 
	Kitsune / Japanese Mask (from milestone 2)
