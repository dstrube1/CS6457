Drivable Car (Steering, Speed, Turning at Cross Streets): 7

Implementing smooth and responsive car controls can be quite complex, especially when accounting for acceleration and turning physics.
Obstacles to Dodge: 5

Coding the logic for stationary and moving obstacles involves collision detection and possibly some AI for moving obstacles, but it's less complex than vehicle control.
Traffic Going Both Ways: 6

Requires AI for other vehicles, including pathfinding and avoiding collisions, which can be moderately complex.
Directions to Next Pick Up/Destination: 4

Displaying visual indicators is not too complex, but coding the logic to calculate 'X' intersections ahead can be somewhat challenging.
Time Limit for 'Tips': 3

Timers are relatively straightforward in Unity, but integrating them with the game's economy system adds complexity.
Selection of Next Passenger(s): 3

Selecting from a list of available passengers is not overly complex, but integrating this with the game's flow adds some complexity.
Endless Generation of Oncoming Terrain: 8

Procedurally generating terrain that is both endless and varied can be quite complex, requiring advanced algorithms.
Certain Number of Missions per Day (or Distance Traveled): 4

Tracking missions or distance is straightforward, but the logic to limit and reset daily can add complexity.
Upgrade or Fix After End of Day: 5

The system itself is not too complex, but connecting it to game progression and economics adds more coding work.
Passenger Ratings: 4

The concept is simple, but coding a system that rates player performance based on multiple factors can be intricate.


If Time Allows:

Traffic Laws: 6
Enforcing traffic laws and having the AI follow them adds a layer of complexity in terms of game rules and AI behavior.

Voice Directions: 2
If using pre-made assets, it's just a matter of triggering audio clips at the right time, which is not very complex.

MiniMap: 5
Creating a minimap involves rendering a second camera view and translating 3D objects to a 2D plane, which can be moderately challenging.


Boss Mode 'Karen' Passenger: 7
This could involve complex AI behavior and unique game events, which would require more coding.

Terrain Become Different Neighborhoods: 7
Switching between different neighborhoods procedurally can involve a lot of coding to ensure variety and seamless transitions.

Fuel Management: 4
Requires a system to decrease fuel over time and interact with fuel stations, which is straightforward but needs to be well-integrated with the gameplay.

Finance (Spend Money per Ride, Possible to Lose Money?): 6
Implementing a financial system that interacts with all aspects of the game (fares, tips, expenses) is relatively complex.

Special Events: 7
Special events can vary greatly in complexity, but they often involve unique gameplay mechanics and triggers, which can be quite involved. 
the numeric rating is an estimated relative effort with 10 being the largest estimated work required.
